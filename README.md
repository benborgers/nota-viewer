I built this website to be able to publish notes from [Nota](https://nota.md), a note-taking app that I use. That way, I could share a link to certain notes, like a publicly shared Google Doc. 

Nota stores notes locally as markdown, but I sync them to a private GitHub repository so I have a backup. This project used the GitHub API to retrieve notes that were tagged as `#public` and display them as a website. 

I took down the hosting for this project because I didnâ€™t see myself using it very much.
